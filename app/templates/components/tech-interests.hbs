	<h4 class="heading-white">Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and Mixed Reality</h4>
	<p class="content">At the pinnacle of every gamer's dream is to one day be able to become fully immersed in the games that they play. This notion is what makes me the most excited about VR, AR, and MR. Of course, there are other purposes for bringing ourselves into another world (VR) or bringing another world into ours (AR and MR) that I find exciting, such as immersive movies, social connections across the world, medical procedure assistants, travel companions, and more. Perhaps the most exciting thing, though, is that once we are able to build virtual worlds like that, are there really any limits to the possibilities of what we can do with them?</p>
	<p class="content">Virtual reality is not necessarily a new idea. In fact, it's been around for decades. But perhaps what's amazing is how it used to take computers of unbelievable size and cost to be able to render these immersive worlds, but with the introduction of devices like the Oculus and the rapid advancements in smart phones the technology and accessibility of VR has been jettisoned into the attention of the common consumer.</p>
	<p class="content">I've built a few virtual reality apps so far, and want to explore more augmented and mixed reality applications as well. I'm love seeing what others have done and their creative ideas, and can't wait to see what comes out of events like the <a href="http://www.vrdconf.com/">Virtual Reality Developer's Conference</a> next, especially as it moves beyond games into other industries with potential for VR. One day, I hope to see, or rather build, immersive virtual worlds that can connect us with experiences that transcend space.</p>

	<h4 class="heading-white">Machine Learning</h4>
	<p class="content">Artificial intelligence has always been a fascination of mine, from the npc companions and enemies in video games that seemingly act on their own to the Google Assistant that constnatly improves the way it understands your habits and interests. With how much more accessible resources for machine learning have become, I want to ride that wave as well and see where it goes in the future.</p>
	<p class="content">Currently I've been playing around with a really cool neural network library called <a href="http://caza.la/synaptic/#/">Synaptic.js</a> that runs in node.js and the browser and plays nicely with my JavaScript skills. It gives a good chance to understand how to use machine learning as far as inputs, outputs, and feedback go, but the library probably does about 95% of the heavy lifting for the neural network. That's why I am currently also exploring artificial intelligence on a more theoretical level to understand the deep mathematical and logical complexities that go into the hidden layer of the ANN.</p>
	<p class="content">What I dream to do with artificial intelligence one day is to build a complete virtual world that can connect all of us, and in this world populate it with artifically intelligent entities that can interact with us as well and make that world feel truly alive.</p>

	<h4 class="heading-white">C# and Unity for Game Development</h4>
	<p class="content">I would betray my love for games if I didn't have a passion for building games as well. Unity is an awesome game engine that allows people to build all kinds of amazing experiences. (<a href="https://unity3d.com/">Link</a> to Unity's main site) I've been messing around with the Unity product and learning C# as well for the scripting. So far I've made a silly little, simple VR game where you shoot oncoming invading bunnies to protect your base. Unity can be used to make all kinds of games from 2D to 3D, but of course I'd gravitate towards VR development for it. Once I get more experience with it, I hope to tackle bigger projects.</p>

	<h4 class="heading-white">Python</h4>
	<p class="content">In order to become a more well-rounded engineer, I've wanted to get better at C++ and learn Python. Python can be used for so many interesting things in web development as well as outside it (such as building games, machine learning, or hardware testing) that I couldn't resist finding out more. So far I've learned a lot of the language's fundamentals and have been using the Django web framework to rebuild the backends for some of my existing projects.</p>
