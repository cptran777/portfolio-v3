		<p class="content">Avalon is a virtual reality multiplayer game that allows groups of 5 to 10 players to connect and play the popular board game, The Resistance: Avalon. Players use the web portal to find each other in lobbies, and the game begins once all players are connected and ready.</p>

		<h3 class="heading-white">Technical Details</h3>
		<h4 class="heading-white">Front End</h4>
		<p class="content">The front end of Avalon was built in React with Redux. React is a lightweight framework that focuses only on view rendering. Because of this, it often allows for faster load times on mobile web development as well, which becomes important in a web VR application. Redux was implemented to centralize and handle state changes that occur when people become connected at different levels of the application. Styling on the webpage portal was designed with Bootstrap. Players can join one of the lobbies on the web portal in order to connect to each other for a game. The lobbies are connected through websockets, which connect to the backend. The connections are grouped and partitioned into individual "rooms" for each lobby, meaning each client in the same room is subscribed to signals only within the "room" that represents the lobby.</p>
		<p class="content">The meat of the front end of the project is the game itself, which was coded in three.js, an abstraction over WebGL. Three.js/WebGL are used to render and animate 3D objects in a web browser. The actual virtual reality experience is achieved using the ideas presented by the Google Cardboard VR experiments that also used Three.js to render a 3D environment. VR view is accomplished by calculating two view points from the origin (which would be the player) and placing these two views side by side to create a stereoscopic effect. Movement and gaze direction within the 3D environment is enabled by translating mobile device orientation and movement into movement of the 3D camera. As a fallback, mouse movement or mobile device press and drag can be used if orientation is not detected.</p>
		<p class="content">Because of the limitations of mobile device web VR without additional input devices such as a wand, a new eventing system had to be created to detect user's gaze direction as input. Gaze direction selects an object through <a href="http://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html">raycasting</a> and using those intersections to detect gazes in 3D space. The eventing system itself is similar to typical event listeners in JavaScript, and was coded in vanilla JavaScript.</p>
		<h4 class="heading-white">Back End</h4>
		<p class="content">For integrity reasons as well as performance reasons, most game logic takes place on the back end. The server cannot be as easily manipulated as the front end, and putting more calculations on the back end frees up resources on the client for the GPU rendering required. Node and Express are used in the back end with game logic files in their own module. A Redis database interacts frequently with the game logic in order to store details about the game state. The game state is checked and updated constantly in a cycle that starts with the server sending the state to the client, the client sends a response to the server based on user input, the server checks the state sent back from the client with an expected state shared between all clients, and then sends a new state to the client.</p>
		<p class="content">User information is stored on a Postgres database. When a user signs up, the username is stored in plain text while the password is hashed using BCrypt, an npm module, and salted before being stored for authentication on the database. At the end of a game, the results are also stored on the user's personal profile as part of total statistics.</p>
